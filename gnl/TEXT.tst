Ambohimanga is a hill and traditional fortified royal settlement (rova) in Madagascar, located approximately 24 kilometres (15 mi) northeast of the capital city of Antananarivo.
The hill and the rova are considered the most significant symbol of the cultural identity of the Merina people and the most important and best-preserved monument of the precolonial Kingdom of Madagascar.
The walled historic village includes tombs of the Vazimba, the island's first inhabitants, and the residences and burial sites of several key monarchs. It remains a place of worship to which pilgrims come. Founded by King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710) as the capital of the Avaradrano region, Ambohimanga is one of the twelve sacred hills of Imerina and contains the house of King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), who led the successful effort to unify most of Madagascar under Merina rule. Ambohimanga was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2001.

Its historic sister city, the Rova of Antananarivo, was destroyed by fire in 1995. Numerous governmental and civil society organizations support the conservation of Ambohimanga by restoring damaged features and preventing further degradation.
